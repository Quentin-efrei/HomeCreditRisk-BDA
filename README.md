## Introduction

The objective of this project was to make predictions from the Home Credit Risk Classification dataset. The dataset is made up of several csv files. For this project, we focused on application_train.csv on which we built our models, then we made our predictions on application_test.csv. The application_train.csv file is composed of 122 columns, the TARGET column represents whether an applicant is able to repay a loan. The application_test.csv file contains the same columns except TARGET which must be predicted. <br>
Here we made our predictions following 3 different models: Xgboost, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
